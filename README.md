# Node Modules Practice

- [ ] Fork and clone this repo
- [ ] Initialize node in your cloned repo so it becomes a node project!

## Make your own module

- [ ] Create a node module that stores an array of your favorite foods
- [ ] Import that module into your `index.js`
- [ ] Write code in your `index.js` so when you run your app, it loops through the array, printing all of your favorite foods to the console

## Experiment with implementing a package

- [ ] Find 3 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages that look interesting
- [ ] Experiment with incorporating them into this node project, just like we did with moment

## Add to your Node app instructions readme

- [ ] Add notes about how to create and import node modules to your Node/Express app readme, along with instructions about adding a `.gitignore`
- [ ] Paste the link to your repo in this the readme of this assignment

## Finally, .gitignore and submit a PR!

- [ ] Add a `.gitignore` to this assignment, so the `node_modules` folder doesn't upload to Github
- [ ] Submit this assignment by making a `pull request`
